        <h1>Comments.</h1>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>Comments in Python are used to provide a brief explanation of what the code is doing, or to disable certain parts of the code 
            temporarily. Comments start with the hash symbol (#) and continue until the end of the line. Python ignores everything after the 
            hash symbol, and it is not executed as part of the program. <br>
            There are two types of comments in Python: <strong>single-line comments</strong> and <strong>multi-line comments.</strong>
        </p><br>
        <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Single-line comments:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (#) and can be 
            written after the code on the same line, or on a separate line:
        </p><br>
        <img class="commentsimg" src="./images/comment1.png" alt=""><br>

        <p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-line comments:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, start and end 
            with three quotation marks (''' or """). Everything between the triple quotes is considered a comment, even if it spans multiple 
            lines:
        </p><br>
        <img class="commentsimg" src="./images/comment2.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>It's good practice to use comments in your code to explain what the code is doing, especially when it's not immediately obvious. 
            Comments can also be useful for temporarily disabling code during testing or development. However, it's important to not overuse 
            comments and to keep them concise and relevant.</p>
        <p><strong>In summary, </strong>comments are an important tool for developers to communicate with each other and to document their code. Well-written comments 
            can help make code easier to understand and maintain, and they can save a lot of time and effort for future developers who need 
            to work with the code.
