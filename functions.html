        <hr class="rule">
        <p>In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called by other parts of a program. Functions 
            in Python are a way to modularize code, making it easier to read, write, and maintain. Functions can have inputs (arguments) and 
            outputs (return values), or they can perform actions without returning anything.  
        </p>
        <p>Functions are defined using the <strong>def keyword</strong>, followed by the name of the function, parentheses that may include arguments, and a 
            colon. The body of the function is indented and contains the code to be executed when the function is called. The general syntax 
            for defining a function in Python is as follows:
        </p><br>
        <img class="functionimg" src="/images/function.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>Here's a breakdown of the different parts of a function: <br>
            <strong>def keyword:</strong>: This indicates that a function is being defined. <br>
            <strong>function_name:</strong> This is the name of the function. It should be a descriptive name that indicates what the function does. <br>
            <strong>parameters:</strong> These are optional input values that the function can take. Parameters are enclosed in parentheses, and multiple 
            parameters are separated by commas. <br>
            <strong>docstring:</strong> This is an optional string that describes what the function does. It is typically included as a comment immediately 
            after the function definition. <br>
            <strong>code block:</strong>: This is the actual code that the function executes when it is called. <br>
            <strong>return:</strong> This statement is used to return a value or values from the function. It is optional, and if it is not included, the 
            function will return None by default. A function can return multiple values as a tuple. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Here's an example of a simple function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:</p><br>
        <img class="function1img" src="/images/function1.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>This will output 8, which is the result of adding x and y together using the add_numbers function.</p>
        <p>In addition to regular arguments, Python functions can also take keyword arguments, which are specified by name instead of 
            position. Below mentioned function takes a name argument and an optional greeting argument. If greeting is not specified, it defaults to
            "Hello".
        </p><br>
        <img class="function1img" src="/images/function2.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>Functions can also have default arguments, which are used when a value is not provided for that argument. Below function takes a 
            base argument and an optional exponent argument, which defaults to 2. If exponent is not specified when the function is called, 
            it will default to 2.
        </p><br>

        <p><strong> In summary, </strong>functions are a powerful feature of programming languages that can help make code more modular, 
            reusable, and easier to maintain. By encapsulating complex logic and functionality into functions, developers can create more 
            efficient and organized code that is easier to read, test, and debug.
