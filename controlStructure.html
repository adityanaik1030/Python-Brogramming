        <h1>Control Structures.</h1>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>Control structures in Python are constructs that allow you to control the flow of execution in a program. They allow you to make 
            decisions, repeat code, and handle errors. The three main types of control structures in Python are:
        </p>
        <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional statements:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional statements allow you to execute different code 
            depending on whether a condition is true or false. The most common conditional statement in Python is the if statement.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loops:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Loops allow you to repeat code a certain number of times or until a condition 
            is met. The two main types of loops in Python are for loops and while loops. A for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list 
            or a string), while a while loop repeats as long as a condition is true.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Control statements:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Control statements are statements that allow the flow of execution to be altered in some way. The most common 
            type of control statement is the "break" statement, which allows a loop to be terminated prematurely. Another type of control 
            statement is the "continue" statement, which allows a loop to skip over certain iterations.

        <h1>1. &nbsp;Conditional statements.</h1>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow the flow of execution to be controlled based on certain conditions. 
            The most common types of conditional statements in Python are "if", "if-else", "elif ladder". Here's an 
            overview of each:
        </p>

        <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;If statement:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most basic conditional statement is the if statement, which is used 
            to execute a block of code if a particular condition is true. Here is the syntax for an if statement:
        </p><br>
        <img class="ifimg" src="/images/if.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces will be executed. If the condition is false, the code 
            will be skipped.
        </p>
        <p>For example, let's say we have a variable x and we want to print a message if x is greater than 5. We can use an if statement to do this:
        </p><br>
        <img class="ifimg" src="/images/if1.png" alt=""><br>


        <p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If-else statement:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The if-else statement allows for two possible outcomes based on a  
            condition. If the condition is true, one block of code is executed; if the condition is false, another block of code is executed. Here's the 
            basic syntax of an if-else statement in Python:
        </p><br>
        <img class="ifelse" src="/images/ifelse.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>If the condition is true, the code inside the first set of curly braces will be executed. If the condition is false, the code inside 
            the second set of curly braces will be executed.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, let's say we have a variable y and we want to print a message if y is even, and a different message if y is odd. 
            We can use an if-else statement to do this:
        </p><br>
        <img class="ifelse" src="/images/ifelse1.png" alt=""><br>

        <p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;elif-else ladder:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have multiple conditions that we want to check, we can use an 
            elif statement. The elif statement is short for "else if", and is used to check additional conditions after the initial if 
            statement. Here is the syntax:
        </p><br>
        <img class="elseif" src="/images/elif.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>For example, let's say we have a variable z and we want to print a message based on its value. If z is greater than 5, we'll 
            print "z is greater than 5". If z is between 0 and 5, we'll print "z is between 0 and 5". Otherwise, we'll print "z is negative".
             We can use an if-elif-else statement to do this:
        </p><br>
        <img class="elseif" src="/images/elif1.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>If the value of z is greater than 5, the message "z is greater than 5" will be printed. If z is between 0 and 5, the message "z 
            is between 0 and 5" will be printed. If z is negative, the message "z is negative" will be printed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>In summary, </strong>conditional statements allow programmers to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. 
            The four most common types of conditional statements are if, if-else, else-if ladder, and switch-case statements. 
            Understanding these constructs is essential for writing effective and efficient code.

        <h1>2. &nbsp;Loops.</h1>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>In Python, for and while loops are used to iterate through a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, or string, and execute 
            a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
        </p>

        <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;For loop:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence of elements and execute 
            a block of code for each element in the sequence. The general syntax for a for loop in Python is:
        </p><br>
        <img class="loopsimg" src="/images/for.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>In this syntax, variable represents the current element in the sequence, and sequence represents the sequence of elements to 
            iterate over. The code block below the for statement will be executed once for each element in the sequence, with variable taking 
            on the value of the current element in each iteration.
        </p>
        <p>For example, let us numbers from 0 to 10 using for loop. Program starts with for keyword followed by variable to iterate and takes 
            range() function which takes arguments.(It can take two arguments specifying the starting value and the end value or it ca take 
            only one argument specifying the end value, starting from 0)
        </p><br>
        <img class="loopsimg" src="/images/for1.png" alt=""><br>

        <p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;While loop:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A while loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long 
            as a certain condition is true. The general syntax for a while loop in Python is:
        </p><br>
        <img class="loopsimg" src="/images/while.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>In this syntax, condition is an expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If condition is true, the code 
            block below the while statement will be executed, and then the condition will be re-evaluated before the next iteration. The loop 
            will continue to execute as long as the condition remains true.
        </p>
        <p>Let us print numbers from 0 to 10 using while loop. Program starts with initializing a variable to 0 and then, while keyword then 
            condition(in this case condition is x<11)
        </p>
        <img class="loopsimg" src="/images/while1.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>
            <strong>In summary, </strong>loops are an essential programming construct that allows for efficient and automated execution of tasks. Understanding the 
            different types of loops and their syntax is crucial for writing effective and efficient code.

        <h1>3. &nbsp;Control statements.</h1>
        <hr class="rule">
        <p>In Python, break and continue are control statements that are used to alter the flow of the loop.
        </p>
         <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Break statement:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;break statement is used to terminate the loop prematurely when a 
            certain condition is met. When break is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program execution 
            moves to the statement immediately after the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, in the following code snippet, the loop will terminate when the value of i becomes 3: 
        </p><br>
        <img class="controlstatementsimg" src="/images/break.png" alt=""><br>

        <p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;continue statement:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the 
            loop and move on to the next iteration, without executing the rest of the loop statements for the current iteration.
        </p>
        <p> For example, in the following code snippet, the loop will skip the iteration where the value of i is 3:</p><br>
        <img class="controlstatementsimg" src="/images/continue.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>
            <strong>In summary, </strong>both break and continue statements can be used with any loop statement, including the for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.
            The use of break and continue statements can make code more efficient and easier to read by allowing a programmer to control the 
            flow of execution of loops in a more precise way.
